Instructions
Step One
Pick one of the following websites:

Amazon

Apple

Best Buy

GameStop

Step Two
Do some exploratory testing and locate the main features and high traffic areas. Using what you learned from today’s lecture, create some documentation you would want to see as a QA on how to properly test that section. Make sure to add any “new” features added and what needs to be working in order to pass our test.
